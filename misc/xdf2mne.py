"""
This module provides methods to transform lsl streams as loaded from a .xdf-file with pyxdf into mne.io.RawArray objects
mne itself does not provide such method
The methods I implemented here are not very sophisticated and do not check many edge cases. The module assumes that
the timestamps for data and marker streams are synchronized and that the stream's sampling rate matches the
nominal sampling rate exactly. Usage of pyxdf's dejitter_timestamps flag when loading the streams is recommended.
If you recorded the data from different devices with unsynced clocks, the timestamps need to be fixed before using this.
